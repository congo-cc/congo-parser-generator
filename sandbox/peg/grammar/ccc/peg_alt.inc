/*
 * This is essentially Bryan Ford's original PEG grammar as defined by his paper 
 * titled "Parsing Expression Grammars: A Recognition-based Syntactic Foundation" 
 * in POPL'04 January 14-16, 2004, Venice, Italy.  It has been extended to illustrate the
 * addition of entailment and repetition cardinality constraints to allow more efficient
 * LL parsing and a compact way to recognize restricted cardinality of Primaries respectively.
 * It also allows several relaxations to the syntax such as "_" in identifiers and the "|" to separate choices, 
 * which are now de facto standards, and both an ASCII version of "entails" and the prioritized choice character and a Unicode version of both that 
 * is more modern. Identifiers may also be surrounded by balanced "<" and ">" to allow external 
 * CongoCC tokens to be referenced or mimicked within the PEG grammar, thereby allowing the PEG grammar 
 * to utilize the full power of the a CongoCC-generated lexer if desired. 
 *
 * N.B., Entailment in Extended PEG functions identically to "=>||" in CongoCC. It is possible
 * that this will change in the future. It is also probable that the original PEG commenting syntax
 * will be changed to match modern conventions (i.e., Java/C-like) and that the "*" will replace the
 * "%" for cardinality predicates.
 *
 * By convention, nonterminals begin with an upper-case letter, terminals are all upper-case, and lexer
 * tokens are all upper-case within "<...>".  Munging and disambiguation element names are prefixed with an 
 * "_" character.
