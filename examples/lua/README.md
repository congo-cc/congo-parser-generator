# Lua Grammar 

This grammar for the Lua language is, as far as I can tell, completely 100% correct, up to Lua 5.4.4.

It parses the entire Lua codebase for the World of Warcraft Interface, https://github.com/tomrus88/BlizzardInterfaceCode which is 1373 source files comprising 460 thousand lines of code. It also parses all of the Lua code in the [neovim repository](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/), something like 200 thousand lines of code. Also the entire codebases of [luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit/) and [lit](https://github.com/luvit/lit/)...

You may use this grammar freely in your own projects, though it would be nice if you acknowledged your use and provided a link to the CongoCC project.
