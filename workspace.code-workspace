// This is a barebones VSCode workspace for working on congocc.
// Actually, I (Revusky) usually use a different workspace file
// that includes some other things I'm working on.
// To use this, you really need to have the Language support for Java installed.
// (I mean this one: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)
// Note that, due to how VSCode works, the extension is typically only activated
// when you first open a .java file.
// Note also that you need to run 'ant test' from the top-level directory or you'll be
// missing files.
